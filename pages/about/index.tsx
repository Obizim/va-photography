          Ansel was a nature lover; this was reflected throughout his photos
          that he took once he became a photographer. He discovered the Yosemite
          and Sierra, Nevada and began taking photos with a Kodak No. 1 Box
          Brownie camera that his parents had given him. He joined the Sierra
          Club in 1919. By 1922, his photographs were appearing in the club's
          bulletin. Ansel began giving tours through the club and took pictures
          of the people and places that they visited. It was on one of these
          trips that he took his famous photograph: Monolith, the Face of Half
          Dome. He also met Mr. Albert M. Bender who was a supporter of the arts
          at this time and he assisted Ansel in preparing his first professional
          portfolio. He is best known for his black and white photographs. The
          rest, as they say, is history.

          Ansel Adams was born February 20, 1902. While his family was wealthy
          at the time of his birth, they fell into financial ruin during the
          Panic of 1907. Nevertheless, his parents and relatives endeavored to
          give him a proper Victorian upbringing in a conservative household.
          Ansel was considered intelligent, though he had trouble learning at
          the local schools. It is believed that he suffered from dyslexia.
          Because of this, he was home schooled and received a diploma from a
          private school, which was the equivalent of an eighth grade education.
